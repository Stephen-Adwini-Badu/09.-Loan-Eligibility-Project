# Loan Prediction Project

## Project Objective
This project aims to predict loan eligibility for potential customers based on various financial, demographic, and personal attributes. By employing machine learning models, the notebook explores how well different algorithms can classify loan applicants into eligible or non-eligible categories.

## Dataset Description
Two datasets are used in this project:
- **Training Dataset:** Contains labeled data to train models.
- **Testing Dataset:** Contains unlabeled data for model evaluation.

Key features in the dataset include:
- **Loan_ID:** Unique loan identifier
- **Gender:** Male/Female
- **Married:** Applicant’s marital status
- **Dependents:** Number of dependents
- **Education:** Applicant’s education level
- **ApplicantIncome:** Income of the applicant
- **CoapplicantIncome:** Income of the co-applicant
- **LoanAmount:** Loan amount requested
- **Loan_Amount_Term:** Term of the loan
- **Credit_History:** Credit history of the applicant
- **Loan_Status:** Target variable (Y/N for eligible/ineligible)

## Methodology
### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- **Loading Data:** Importing training and testing datasets.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
- **Data Transformation:** Encoding categorical variables for machine learning models.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Data Insights:** Analyzing distributions, relationships, and summary statistics of features.
- **Visualization Techniques:** Utilizing Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify trends and correlations.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Selecting relevant features based on data insights.
- Handling categorical data through label encoding and other transformations.
- Normalizing continuous variables where appropriate.

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- Training machine learning models:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
- Evaluation metrics include:
  - Accuracy
